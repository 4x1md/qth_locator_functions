# QTH Locator Functions
Python functions for converting decimal coordinates to QTH locator and backwards.

## Latitude And Longitude
```

## QTH Locator Format

![QTH locator format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4x5dm/qth_locator_functions/master/images/qth_locator_format.png)

The Earth's surface is divided into 18x18 fields. Each field is 20°x10° (Lon x Lat). Filed numbers are encoded by first two letters of QTH locator.

Each field is divided into 10x10. Each square is 2°x1°. Square numbers are encoded by first digits pair.

Each square is divided into 24x24 subsquares. Each subsquare is 5'x2.5'. Square is encoded by second two letters of the locator.

Each square is divided into 10x10 extended squares. Each extended square is 0.5'x0.25'. Extended square is encoded by the last two digits of the locator.

## QTH Locator Example

``` KM72jb18 ```

``` K ``` - encodes the 10-th field of longitude (counting from 0),

``` M ``` - encodes the 12-th field of latitude (counting from 0),

``` 7 ``` - encodes the 7-th square of longitude (counting from 0),

``` 2 ``` - encodes the second square of latitude (counting from 0),

``` j ``` - encodes the 9-th subsquare of longitude (counting from 0),

``` b ``` - encodes the first subsquare of latitude (counting from 0),

``` 1 ``` - encodes the first extended square of longitude (counting from 0),

``` 8 ``` - encodes the 8-th extended square of latitude (counting from 0),

It will be translated to coordinates in the following way.

Longitude: ``` -180° + 20°*10 + 2°*7 + 5'*9 + 0.5'*1 = 34°45.5' = 34.75833 ```

Latitude: ``` -90° + 10°*12 + 1°*2 + 2.5'*1 + 0.25'*8 = 32°4.5' = 32.075 ```
